            <h2>3. Lower Operational Costs</h2>
            <p>Compared to cities like <strong>Bangalore</strong>, <strong>Mumbai</strong>, or <strong>Delhi</strong>, Chennai offers:</p>

        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>5. Strategic Location & Connectivity</h2>
            <p>Chennai is a <strong>major port city</strong>, well-connected by road, rail, air, and sea. Its international airport and major seaport make it easy for global companies to do business from here.</p>

            <h2>7. Stable Workforce</h2>
            <p>Chennai’s workforce is known for its <strong>stability and loyalty</strong>, especially compared to more transient workforces in places like Bangalore. This means:</p>

                <li>Longer employee retention</li>

        <section>
            <h2>Why Not Other Cities?</h2>
            <p>While other Indian cities also have potential, many face challenges like:</p>

            <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
